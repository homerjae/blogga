**Opus Primum** of latin meaning first work. This blog will tap into the intelligent side of your mind without being esoteric(refers to ideas, practices, or knowledge that are obscure or not widely known or understood by the general public.) and exclusionary. When I do find the time to read I like to look up words that I don't know so I will also put definitons of words to keep this blog on a level field and to understood. What's the point of big words if nobody knows what I'm saying?

- **What is this blog about?** General Thoughts on Current Affairs will be written out here as will food reviews and the latest videos I believe should be thought about all while still posting my favorite memes. We will keep this blog sophisticated all while having a good laugh at the absurdity that is life.
- **Open discussion** I will open a dialogue box evetnually and link it here. I would like to read through readers feedback and post my favorite ideas to the forum.

This site will be unddergoing constant change as I practice my next.js skills any feedback can be emailed to me, this includes areas for improvement. Thank you for reading.
